A Kanye West Wordle spinoff created with React.\
The game uses the Spotify API to collect info on all of Kanye West's singles (203 songs).\
A target song is selected and the player must guess songs until the target song is guessed.

Guessing categories are based on:
- Album: If target song is from the same album
- Duration: If target song is longer or shorter
- Name: If target song is higher or lower alphabetically
